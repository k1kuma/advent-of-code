# Advent of Code

Welcome to Matt Kikuchi's Advent of Code repository. Advent of Code is a series of puzzles
released every year from December 1st to Christmas Day, with each puzzle having two parts. 

Puzzles come in a variety of difficulty levels and can be solved in any programming language.
This repo mostly contains solutions written in Node (https://nodejs.org).

Please see https://adventofcode.com/2020/about to learn more about Advent of Code. 

To run a problem, go into the path of the year and day and run the following command:

```
    cd [path_of_file.js]
    node fileName.js
```

Let's do it...
