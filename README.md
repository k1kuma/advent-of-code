# Advent of Code

Welcome to the Advent of Code Repository. There will be coding challenges from DEC 01 all the way to DEC 25 and the plan
is to write them all in javascript.

2019 is now acrhived as we start 2021. 

To run a problem, go into the path of the year and day and run the following command:

```
    cd [path_of_file.js]
    node fileName.js
```

Let's do it...
